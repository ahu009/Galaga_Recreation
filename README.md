# Galaga_Recreation

Created two versions of the game: one in the native processing IDE and one in Eclipse.

Eclipse
----------------------
The .java file is very messy(didn't know how to create objects that worked with processing)

Processing IDE
----------------------
The .pde files are cleaner(classes were much easier to implement)

Controls for the game: 
----------------------
- 'a': move left
- 'd': move right
- 'k': shoot bullet
